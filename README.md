# Bashdio
It's my first bigger project, which is kind of finished (definitly needs some improvements), fully working.

Audio player on local terminal-styled website.

Some preview screens can be found in preview folder.

Help command might be usefull.

Full commands list may be found in command Documentation folder.

To start playing audio the fastest way to do it is:

Type "load" <- file load window will be opened then and select as many songs as u want.

Then just type "start".
